## Set up a GitHub account

To get a copy of this repository, you will need to
have [set up a GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github),
so we can set up a git repository for your project. If you already have one, login to it.

Once you have set up a GitHub account, you can proceed to [forking the repository](#fork-the-repository).

## Fork the repository

To get a copy of this repository, you will need to fork it. Click on the `Fork` button at the top right
of [this page](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-cad-workshop).

## Clone the repository

To clone the repository, you will need to copy the URL of your forked repository. You can do this by clicking on the
`Code` button on your forked repository and copying the URL.

Then, open a terminal or command prompt as during installation earlier and run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<GITHUB_USERNAME>/aptos-cad-workshop
```

Replace `<GITHUB_USERNAME>` with your GitHub username.

## Optional: Install IDE

If you don't have an IDE, we recommend you install Visual Studio Code. You can download
it [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).

## Install Petra wallet

To install
[download the Petra wallet from the Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/petra-aptos-wallet/ejjladinnckdgjemekebdpeokbikhfci?pli=1).

Then create a new account: https://petra.app/docs/use#create-a-new-account

And switch to the Testnet network: https://petra.app/docs/use#change-wallet-network

# Create the template dApp

Great!  Now that you have all the prerequisites set up, you can create the template dApp.

To run the `create-aptos-dapp` script, you will need to navigate to the repository you just cloned. You can do this by
running the following command:

```bash
cd aptos-cad-workshop
```

Then, you can run the `create-aptos-dapp` script by running the following command:

```bash
npx create-aptos-dapp@latest
```

It will ask you to confirm with `y` on a message like this:

```bash
Need to install the following packages:
create-aptos-dapp@0.0.22
Ok to proceed? (y) 
```

After you confirm, it will ask you to enter the name of your dApp. Let's enter `workshop` and press `Enter`:

```bash
   ###    ########  ########  #######   ######  
  ## ##   ##     ##    ##    ##     ## ##    ## 
 ##   ##  ##     ##    ##    ##     ## ##       
##     ## ########     ##    ##     ##  ######  
######### ##           ##    ##     ##       ## 
##     ## ##           ##    ##     ## ##    ## 
##     ## ##           ##     #######   ######                                                     

Welcome to the create-aptos-dapp wizard 🌐
? Enter a new project name › workshop
```

After this point, we will want to choose the `NFT minting dapp` option, push down arrow key to select it and press
`Enter`:

```bash
? Choose how to start › - Use arrow-keys. Return to submit.
    Boilerplate Template
❯   NFT minting dapp - A production ready template to create an NFT collection minting dapp
    Token minting dapp
    Token staking dapp
```

Once that is chosen, it will ask you choose your network. Choose `Testnet` by pushing the down arrow key and press
`Enter`:

```bash
? Choose your network › - You can change this later
    Mainnet
❯   Testnet
```

It will then ask you if you want to provide collection anonymous data, choose either `Y` for yes or `N` for no and press
`Enter`:

```bash
? Help us improve create-aptos-dapp by collection anonymous data › (Y/n)
```

Finally, it'll ask you if you want to make any changes, simply press `Enter`:

```bash
? Do you want to make any changes to your selections? (Default is No) › (y/N)
```

Great! You have now created your dApp. You can now navigate to the `workshop` directory by running the following
command:

```bash
cd workshop
```

Let's save our status and push it to our GitHub repository so we don't lose our progress:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial workshop setup"
git push
```

## Start the dApp locally

You can start the dApp locally by running the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

And it will be available to access at http://localhost:5173

# Configure the dApp

This is a simplified version of the dev docs for the NFT Minting
tutorial [here](https://aptos.dev/en/build/create-aptos-dapp/templates/nft-minting-dapp#create-collection-assets)

## Set up the Aptos account

For the dApp to be useful, we will want to create an account and publish an NFT minting contract. First we will
initialize the Aptos account by running the following command and pushing `Enter` through all prompts:

```bash
npm run move:init
```

This will create an account for the dApp to use with an output like:

```bash
npm run move:init

> boilerplate-template@0.0.0 move:init
> node ./scripts/init

Aptos CLI is now set up for account 0x7ea046db202cbe947dd5e0e8fe411cbfb14c5bd5c09b10e1ce43c80ec3395866 as profile workshop-testnet!
 See the account here: https://explorer.aptoslabs.com/account/0x7ea046db202cbe947dd5e0e8fe411cbfb14c5bd5c09b10e1ce43c80ec3395866?network=testnet
 Run `aptos --help` for more information about commands
{
  "Result": "Success"
}
```

In this example `0x7ea046db202cbe947dd5e0e8fe411cbfb14c5bd5c09b10e1ce43c80ec3395866` is the account that was created in
testnet. We will now need to put it into the `.env` file in the root of the project. You can do this by editing the
`.env` file or running the following command:

On macOS or Linux, you can run the following command filling in `<address>` with the address from the output above:

```bash
echo "\nVITE_MODULE_ADDRESS=<address>\n" >> .env
```

On Windows, you can run the following command:

```powershell
ECHO "\nVITE_MODULE_ADDRESS=<address>\n" >> .env
```

## Publish the NFT minting contract

Now, we will want to publish our NFT minting contract, so it can be used by the dApp. You can do this by running the
following command and pushing `y` and `Enter` through all prompts:

```bash
npm run move:publish
```

The output will look like:

```bash

> boilerplate-template@0.0.0 move:publish
> node ./scripts/move/publish

{
  "Result": "Success"
}
```

## Publish the collection

You will need to copy your address from the Petra wallet, if it is not already set up.

On macOS or Linux, you can run the following command filling in `<address>` with the address from your Petra wallet
above:

```bash
echo "\nVITE_COLLECTION_CREATOR_ADDRESS=<address>\n" >> .env
```

On Windows, you can run the following command:

```powershell
ECHO "\nVITE_COLLECTION_CREATOR_ADDRESS=<address>\n" >> .env
```

Now, we will want to publish our NFT collection, this can be done by the UI. Start the website with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

- Navigate to http://localhost:5173.
- Click on the `Connect a Wallet` button. To connect your wallet.
- Click on `Connect` next to `Petra`, to connect your `Petra wallet`.
- Approve the connection in the `Petra wallet` popup.
- Click on the `Create Collection` button. This will publish the collection
- Click `Choose Folder to Upload` and choose the `assets` folder in the root of the project.
- Add now to the public mint start date
- Click `Create Collection` and approve the prompts.

You will then get a collection address, and will need to set `fronte3nd/config.ts`, and fill in the `collection_id`

## Mint NFTs

Going back to the website http://localhost:5173, then you can click the mint button and mint your first NFT!

## Push the dApp to vercel

Now that the collection is published, we will want to publish the dApp to a real website. But first, let's push our
changes to the repository:

```bash
git add .       # Add all files
git add .env -f # Force add the .env file so the website works correctly in Vercel
git commit -m "Added collection details"
git push
```

### Publish via CLI

At this point, you can deploy to Vercel either by running a CLI command if you have a Vercel account:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

It will output something like:

```bash

> nft-minting-dapp-template@0.0.0 deploy
> vercel
